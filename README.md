# Ion-nuclei-collisions

In this project, we model particle ejection during ion-nuclei collisions, where we focused on understanding how various physical distributions (energy and angle) govern the behaviour of particles post-collision. We developed several simulations to model realistic particle interactions based on physical principles like the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution and Rutherford scattering, commonly encountered in real-life nuclear physics experiments.

# Basic particle simulation

In this first simulation, we modeled a basic nuclear physics experiment where a random distribution of particles is ejected from a collision. The energy and angle of the ejected fragments (protons, neutrons, and alpha particles) were assigned based on uniform probability distributions, meaning each value had an equal chance of being selected. This simple model was a starting point for analyzing how particle types can be distributed in basic scattering events.

# Maxwell-Boltzmann 

More realistic distribution by applying the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution to model the energy of the ejected particles.

# Rutherford Scattering

Simplified version of Rutherford scattering to model the angular distribution of ejected particles.

# Combined Maxwell-Boltzmann Energy and Rutherford Angular Distribution

Combined the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution with the Rutherford scattering angular distribution to create the most realistic model we developed. In this model, particle energies were distributed according to thermal principles (Maxwell-Boltzmann), and their scattering angles followed the inverse-square law of Rutherford scattering. This combination provides a realistic simulation of particles' behaviors post-collision.
